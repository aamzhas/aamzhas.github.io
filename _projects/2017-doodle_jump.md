Developed the game “Doodle Jump” on the Altera DE-2 FPGA board as the final project for ECE 385 using System Verilog. The game used an USB mouse connection to move ‘Doodle’ and shoot enemies, and showed the gameplay with two types of monsters in a pseudo-randomly generated world on a VGA monitor.

## Technologies used

* System Verilog
* Interface with VGA monitor, ps2 keyboard, and USB mouse.

## A poorly recorded snapchat video of the game

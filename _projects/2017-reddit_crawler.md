Developed a Reddit Bot to crawl through selected subreddits and find the frequency of selected words in the comments to create visualizations about the popularity of the words

Applied the bot on all the Game of Thrones subreddits to extract data about how popular the characters are with redditors and visualize it, this was back when I still liked the show :'(

## Technologies used
* Python
* PRAW

## Current Status
Crawler still works, but abandoned Game of Thrones branch because the ending of the show made me hate everything related to it.
